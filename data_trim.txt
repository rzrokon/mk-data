thank you very much and a very good
morning
to mohit kapoor chaya segal madam
all the colleagues in executive
committee of
bombay management association my
colleagues from jamnalal
institute of management studies and
participants of leader 2020 and leader
next
it's again a very
interesting and very enriching and
experience we are going to go through
for last
few months for leader next i have been
listening to the wise words of
many of the leaders and this is one of
them
the series is leaderspeak and today we
have mohit kapoor
and we are looking forward for open
innovation and strategic leadership as
the title suggests
last few weeks we are engaged in
the development of leadership and
various
angles we had seen the new styles of
leadership
the ones which have been proven all
those
discussions in the classes are going on
but along with that the experience
and the learnings from the leaders is
another enhancing feature for this
leadership
management program that we are offering
since 2019
today we have with us mohit kapoor
an alumnus of nus singapore
and currently a group vice president of
advertising
and innovation in jio platforms limited
the world's
largest data carrier and india's largest
telco subscriber the based on
subscribers and revenue with
400 plus million million subscribers
he is also a mentor at geo gen next
the venture arm of reliance earlier in
his
career he held senior leadership
positions in multinationals
alcatel higher used starcom
and indian consumer electronics giants
videocon he has also founded two
startups
gulen and apps kiosk it is apt to
understand
from the leader who has done it himself
the innovation
and leading the innovation of a large
telecom
the giant so i am very happy to
welcome mr mohit kapoor and
all of you to this enriching session of
leader
next thank you
thank you dr as you would have picked up
from that
in addition to being the incoming
president of bma she is also the
director of the
general institute of finance studies and
therefore a distinct pleasure to have
her here and to
also have uh miss charles here who has
been the advisor and mentor who has
really shaped the leader next
program and therefore on behalf of all
of us again we welcome mr mohit kapoor
mr kapoor we will have a format as we
discussed earlier that
you of course share what you are sharing
and after that we'll leave some time for
a question and answers
particularly from some of our committee
members as well as the
students of the program so over to you
without further ado
all yours thank you
thanks a lot i think it's a it's almost
generous uh
introduction uh thanks for that so uh
good morning everyone
uh you know very happy to be here and i
think
the first thing i want to say is that uh
you know i hope everyone is staying safe
taking care
uh these are very unique times the world
and specifically india
and some parts of india which are going
through and uh
you know i've been uh firsthand uh you
know
also managing uh you know you know yeah
you know some of those both uh some of
the covered issues but uh
please take care uh today uh
you know what i uh what i want to talk
about is actually very close to my heart
uh we're gonna be talking about uh
innovation and you know and basically
the
the you know the first principles of of
innovation
and so basically i i will start with few
building blocks of first principles and
talk a little bit about innovation
and then really talk about some examples
and
uh always you know basically end this
presentation with with
uh with good number of examples uh of
what how jio has
uh or reliance as a group has
successfully used first principles uh
to deliver many firsts in many
innovations so
uh so yeah so it's basically the example
is right in the end
but this format was important uh you
know to basically explain the whole
concept
so uh going forward let me uh
one second
so you know first principles thinkers i
do not know how many people
actually are aware about first
principles
and about first principles thinkers but
uh
every major innovation which is
happening in the world
historically you know has happened using
first principles only
some of the famous thinkers are uh
you know aristotle nikola tesla thomas
edison
elon musk if you go through you know a
lot of his videos
he talks about first principles a lot
actually and
uh you know and then all four of them
and uh and i can tell you you know in in
reliance
our chairman mr mukesh amani talks about
first principles a lot actually
and and i'll do some examples uh as we
go forward
but uh yeah so the concept is very it's
nothing new it's very uh it's historic
uh and uh has been input has been in use
uh you know i'll just just keep on
saying
yeah now you know for
for the people who do not know the
concept of first principles
basically you know it's it's a concept
where you boil
problems down to the most fundamental
truths
right and uh it's actually reducing the
idea down
uh you know to its smallest fundamental
that can be conceived okay that can be
conceived
and that's how you arrive on a first
principle and i will actually give
examples going forward
uh you know just to be more clear but uh
but it's it's a way of uh
uh you know looking at things uh that
you look at categories but then you
start
coming down and you start looking at sub
categories and you really come down to
the smallest sub category
and uh and uh you know so it's it's it's
a way of thinking
and uh and i would i will detail that
going for going forward it's also called
the physics way of thinking
and uh and whatever
yeah can everyone go and mute it
so there's a query i'm happy to uh
there's some elonga who's uh who's not a
mute if we can go
please
yeah so the uh you know when we talk
about first principles we're talking
about
things which are timeless you know
they're known by nature
they always will be you know are true so
they're not basically linked to who
is thinking it's aristotle or it's elon
musk or or it is uh
anybody or it's uh you know you know
but but the truth the universal truths
remain the same it's just a way of
thinking
right from that you know the
foundational principles of you know
or their fundamentals uh but let me
explain this what i'm trying to say
uh you know through some examples
and uh so let me give you one example
right so so let's say there's a
there's a tree with the bearing fruits
now normally you know when we look at
fruit
you know and we come to the point it's
how this creation really came to be
there are actually very few people who
have a way of thinking which says which
is
yes it's a fruit but where did the fruit
came come from it came from the branches
where the branches come from it came
from the trunk or the tree and where did
the trunk come from
from the roots and you know and who you
know what is happening with the roots is
basically the soil
so you know your fruit is more delicious
in a good you know the soil is good
and that's the most fundamental part of
the fruit right so
it is uh so it's it's basically first
principles this
is really breaking things down to the
last level
right uh i mean and you can go further
down inside uh
you know inside soil as well you know
what other nutrients or micronutrients
you know which are making so that's
that's just a way of thinking and then
uh and i'll discuss this and how this
way of thinking how this uh you know has
built
you know a large group like reliance or
large uh company like tesla and you know
and then
and globally you know massive uh
things have happened just by some people
thinking
in the following way right i'll give you
one more example just for
for further clarity so first principles
is basically
you know it's breaking down a problem so
for example if you take battery pack
right now uh so there's this famous
example of
elon musk and battery packs right now
you know elon musk would always break
things down so what is a battery pack it
has got cobalt
nickel aluminium carbon polymers seal
cap right and then various
proportions and uh and he figured out
that
uh you know the uh the cost uh is about
close to six hundred dollars per
kilowatt
uh hour uh you know on the battery and
uh
and and given the the ingredients which
are going in it can be taken down to
and it and he did take it down to uh you
know 80 dollars per kilowatt hour
and it was basically you know once you
have really come down to the
to each and every component uh
and you know the the the smallest sub
category
then it's a matter of putting you know
then putting the
the ingredients together in a smart way
and uh you know and and to achieve
a cheaper battery pack or or do further
optimization etc but that's that's a
simple way of thinking so i just wanted
to put this
out very simply so that everyone
understands it
and i know i'm talking uh uh
you know very very simple things but
i'll come and explain
you know going forward how important
this concept is right
uh so broadly you know i can tell you
whatever
whatever i learned about first
principles i learned it in reliance
i'm actually completing seven years soon
in uh in ngo
uh you know i was there for the in the
planning process and uh
a lot of things i did not understand you
know why we spent so much time
planning and uh you know and uh i mean
we
we we've spent 90 percent over 95 of our
time only
on the planning process and five percent
actually you know you know
on the solution uh so uh but broadly
speaking
you know first principle thinkers and
conventional thinkers they are
you know uh you know different set of
people
the first principle thinker uh and there
are a lot of lot of them in reliance i
can tell you
you know they are ultimate truth
speakers uh seekers you know
they never satisfied with you know only
the fruit and
you know they realized that the search
for roots is never ending so it's it's
it's it's kind of a never-ending uh
journey and
uh you know and many ideas an asset
inside and outside you know
uh of one another job of the first
principle thinker is to map
out how these ideas are interlinked so
it's a lot of thinking we're talking
about
and uh you know so i think the the thing
is that you know powerful questions you
know lead to powerful answers
you know and uh by breaking down the
problems and uh
you know so if you've done uh if if
you've thought over
a problem you know beautifully on the
you know at the the sub-category level
uh or at the fir you know
you know using first principles you know
your final idea
and product would actually be very true
and beautiful
so so it's really working on the you
know the smaller smaller parts
and on the contrary if you look at the
conventional thinkers right
they're mostly you know the more party
set of people i mean uh
you know fruit seeds can be planted
anywhere i mean because it's just
concerned with the
focus on fruit only and uh and the
knowledge
usually exists solely on the you know on
the product
and uh and all the interesting facts of
the
of that product you know which can be
displayed and uh there's not enough
knowledge
uh deeper knowledge about uh you know
about the product uh
you know where it is coming from what
are the ingredients and you know things
like that
so that's broadly about uh but i was
surprised that you know and i was i was
a conventional thinker
and uh but i've seen the difference uh
you know which comes by when you start
thinking i think differently so
that was so i was basically talking a
bit about
um you know we might have a much shorter
presentation we'll keep more time for uh
for question answers uh so
i just set a foundation about a certain
way of thinking
and some of the most iconic people in
the globe
thinking like that and you know how this
thinking translates into innovation
and i'm going to talk a little bit about
that see what happens is that
see once you are at the very beginning
of a problem
right you can start to create new
knowledge and solution from scratch
uh so so for example you know it could
be any problem you're just solving you
could be
building a building a home and uh you
know
one way of looking at is that is to get
a contractor get an architect
you know basically you know work with
analogies
you look at how other houses have gone
about and you know have my
you know certain options uh combination
etc but
uh but when you really go to the scratch
then you know what does it really take
to to build a home right uh you know you
it's the foundation it's the steel it's
a sement it's the bricks you know
and what really constitutes into bricks
and steel and uh etc
and then wood and uh you know you are
you're already thinking very different
so you really go down to the scratch so
and so when you create a house or an
idea whatever the case may be
you know what you are then what you're
about to create is very different
uh you know because you really gone to
the you know to the
right to the core so uh
you know you you're able to create your
own assumptions and you're able to
really create a true innovation and i'll
take some i'll give you some examples
on innovations as well and how this gets
it really applied
so but but simply speaking when you
understand the fundamentals of an idea
you can rearrange them change them or
put them together
differently to create a new product or
an idea
so again the point really comes down to
the fundamental blocks
once you understand that innovation
becomes quite
actually it's never easy but it still
becomes
uh simple
now and you know and on the on the
innovation side
uh you know so so basically what's
happening here is let me
let me let me take some examples here so
when you've figured out the letters
you know abc the ef etc you know it's
easy for you to do the words
and once once you've done the words you
can do the sentences
and from sentences you can do paragraphs
and from paragraphs to essays to books
in the entire library
the important word here is letters right
in everything which we do
and uh you know and and the fundamental
component can be changed in order to
improve
right because you want because of
fundamental component as an example here
is letters for example
right so so again you know once we
understand the found
the foundational components of an idea
or a product it becomes a lot easier
to integrate a new knowledge in the
understanding and then you can
transfer in as many complex ideas as
possible
so yeah i hope the base is fine and
is it uh let me just you know open uh
open it for now any any queries anyone
anybody have any uh
should i just keep going keep
going yeah all right great
so so we spoke about first principles
you know fundamental components you know
foundations
and then i've translated that into into
innovation
uh and i'm gonna just i'm not gonna talk
a lot about strategic leadership
i think i think that's uh it's changing
a lot the leaders uh
today uh you know have to be
uh you know the successful leaders today
are very uh
you know are and will be very different
and it's uh and
and they better be operating with you
know with the first
principles understanding and uh because
uh
you know the world has changed so fast
so quickly right
uh but i think i i just picked up two
quotes uh you know one from einstein and
one from
from elon musk and i'll probably take a
say a few quotes with um which mukesh
bye mentions a lot uh
as well but uh but yeah i think we're
all
as leaders you know we are all problem
solvers
it doesn't it could be bill gates or
elon musk or it could be yourself
you know managing the or creating or you
know whatever the case may be and you
know
as long as we're leading in any
situation uh
you know the important thing in the
night what einstein used to say is that
you know if if i have an hour to solve a
problem i'd spend about 55 minutes
thinking about the problem and about
five minutes thinking about the solution
you know the the the magic word here is
you know spending 90 95 time thinking
about the problem
right not the solution and uh and then
you know that
that helps you create uh that helps you
create actually let me just
say that much elon musk also i think he
believes that i think he thinks most
people can learn a lot more
than they think they can they just
somehow sell themselves short without
trying and i'll probably
detail that as we go forward and i'll
talk about
you know leadership as well
i i'll i'll share a few things that
makes my uh
you know taught us i mean you know he
talks a lot about insight and foresight
right and uh for every leader to have
both uh you know insight and foresight
uh and uh and there are tons of examples
uh
you know out there but uh but let me go
back
you know to uh lead successful leaders
basically being
really good problem solvers and to solve
problems
leaders actually spending a lot of time
on the staying with the problem and uh
and when you and to spend uh spend a lot
of time with the problem
you really have to break down that
problem into the smallest possible
fundamental component of a unit right
and uh
and then you know what what gets created
is actually very
very different so uh so thinking the
first principles
uh is simple but it's actually not easy
and
uh and i'll you know i'll i'll take you
through now some other some of the
you know few examples uh and
uh you know so okay and i'd probably
just have one which i'll just speak out
after these examples so let me give you
just
one let's say global example you know
just out of the blue
now so one innovation story that where
you see first principles in action
and uh and you will see that how
important first principles have been you
know and how central they've been
in all important inventions that have
happened in the world right
and uh so just to give you an example
from the earliest of the times you know
the soldiers used to carry these
messenger bags
and uh and of course you know new
applications for that bags were created
because you can use them for traveling
new incremental innovations that had
happened you know somebody added chain
somebody changed the material to polymer
and uh
you know and uh a lot of these small
innovations in moisture
you know what time but actually you know
the most important problem of luggage
was solved only in 1970 which is you
know
some of uh you know some of us were born
before that actually and
we think all innovation you know what
happened centuries ago and
it actually that and and this uh
innovation was done by bernard
sado very simple you know he was
actually
carrying a very heavy bag uh you know uh
you know at the airport and and he saw a
worker
carrying a bag carrying a lot of banks
on a small cart
you know and being transporting you to
the plane and
and that's where you know the first
principles in action and i mean
he thought in a very methodical way that
you know what
potential what is what could be a modern
bag concept
it should be it should provide safety
for goods
it should be lightweight because you can
carry it around it should be standard
size for train and flight
it should be easy to transport and that
basically meant
adding wheels in the bag and you know
it's and it was more like a mini cart
which
which he saw but uh see sometimes just
thinking
so simple and at a such a foundational
level
creates massive innovations you know
that's in a different world right now
with the bag which you can you know uh
trolley around
so every one of the class another about
i see about 95 or on the sonic people
and probably more on youtube so
anybody can do innovations you know by
thinking very simple
and uh you know and and breaking things
down to it
at a competent level and uh and
so as the business problems as the
product ingredients as many things
uh but uh that's how it works so
the other part is uh and i think from
from here
we will move to uh q a i kept it short
because i wanted
you know one specific message to go out
because i think
the leaders of today need it and uh
so but we'll keep most of the time for
for q a but let me also share some
examples
uh you know how first principles is an
action in the reliance
group right and uh broadly speaking you
know if you really go back to reliance's
history right uh
uh you know when it really started uh
india had to be closed
you know that and uh and reliance uh got
into
you know uh polyester and you know uh
and then you know it's today carries a
certain weight in the global global
market
but you know but glance was clear about
uh it
operated in a certain way and then you
know if you look at every business that
moved in you know from
in oil and hydrocarbon and then uh
even plastics right and people people's
uh life had to be improved because
people needed to brushes things like
that you know
some india has to have to move forward
and then finally you know recently
you know there's retail as well and not
more recently on telecom i'm going to be
talking
mostly in telecom but but all the
businesses reliance moved into
it's it's actually a story of first
principles and but let me just zoom into
more
at least which and with my area or you
know where i'd be arrived
the part of the alliance i work in which
is due so i'll share some examples with
you i still remember you know and i was
part of the planning
uh you know when the planning was on uh
in june
uh one problem came to us where
you know uh you know mr makeshifi wanted
to actually
collect you know 100 million subscribers
at a very rapid pace
right and uh and you know
we don't say publicly but we were we
were tasked with a target internally at
100 million in 100 days externally i
think we put out 180 days
we delivered that 170 days i remember
and with
you know hell it broke in you know you
know that kind of time to deliver that
but
one of the most critical things to
achieve that was
that we are able to actually uh give
pre-activated sim cards or we can
basically
activate sim cards in five minutes and
uh if we don't do that the the match
state does not work
so how do you really activate so many
people so quickly so that you know we
ramp up to the numbers which is so that
that's the time the whole aadhaar based
kyc came around
right which reliance uh innovated
and delivered so and it was really
the same process of breaking down the
government defined process and you know
and creating solutions
and uh and and you know and and i can
tell you uh
you know this was first principles in
actions that's one the second example
i'll share with you i still remember
right um you know
jio made voice free when it launched you
know four years ago
and uh i still know and some of my
friends say that you know what you you
know realizes an oil company they have a
lot of
and they can probably afford it and you
know the fact is and then i've seen the
planning
that the real story was that we're an ip
network right
the voice in case of reliance works on
data
right and uh and we did some
calculations we figured out
that uh you know it it costs uh
half gig of data uh you know in a year
uh you know to basically you know that's
that's the cost of running voice
for you know whatever average number of
people average amount of time people are
talking in a day etc
so and the data used to cost at that
point of time around you know 200
rupees i remember uh per gig so 100 110
bucks
in that range was uh you know was all it
was uh
you know costing so just to tell you
right uh you know it would have costed
us
more to send a bill out for voice uh
you know uh you know then charging you
know
and so it was a technologically a
technological innovation and it was uh
that there was a lot of there was first
principles involved there
the many examples today you know just to
achieve
the lowest 4g data rates in the world
it has happened with a lot of
efficiencies
which are under the network we you know
reliance our jio is only network which
which does very large part of
uh the network uh so we have our own
towers we have our own
uh you know uh
you know iso uh you know so so you know
while other
other telcos actually you know divide
multiple pieces and pass it to the
vendors
we actually in sourced you just to get
the pricing right but you can do it
because if you have broken down your
your entire project into this you know
to
the foundational uh you know components
and but it's valuable and i think this
is one thing which can go from reliance
to
you know to other companies and a lot of
companies apply that
uh you know you know this is this is one
of the most powerful things
i'll share one one more example right so
if you remember
uh just to let you know guys that we're
about 850 odd million approximately in
that range don't hold me for the exact
numbers
uh that's the number of devices which we
have in the country they used to be
half half our feature phones half
smartphones smartphones have now grown
to about 500 million feature phones are
still in the 300 350 million range
and uh the point is that in the
smartphone you know there are these uh
standard os you know there's an android
and ios
you know which exists but uh you know
there's no proprietary
uh os in the at the segment below now
reliance had
the the will the uh
you know and the courage uh and the
expertise and
and and you know that to to actually
build a product like jio phone
where we build our own os on top of uh
we call it kios actually
we built uh the world's first 4g
entry-level device uh in which people
are today
streaming music streaming videos playing
games
and host of applications you know made
internet possible to a segment
which was unimagined you know till the
time this was the phone was actually
launched
so plenty of those things now let me
come down to
you know maybe i'll probably share a few
examples so
with all the learnings at a group level
and
and personally i can see you know for
myself and for uh you know for my team
and what we've inculcated we were able
to apply the same first principles
into dozens uh multiple dozens of
advertising partnerships
because uh uh what we realized is that
uh
that we did because iran advertising
here uh in jio and tracing innovations
and uh the way we look at advertising so
typically i've seen google's and
facebooks and
uh and uh you know a lot of the otd
players
would have very standardized approach uh
you know standardized inventories for
you can advertise et cetera on
but when we looked at jio we said okay
we've got we got a lot of things here
we've got
uh we've got geomark there's commerce
happening there we've got a lot of
physical locations
uh like uh reliance fresh and smart and
trends that
we have jio points across india we have
uh
apps like jio tv my jio and and all of
that
we had we realized we broke every
possible
advertising uh asset which we had into
the smallest possible component
and we and then and then the magic is to
basically use
different components together at
different and create innovations
for partners so we uh we're having a lot
of fun thinking like that i think we've
delivered uh
you know we've delivered some some some
some extremely award-winning work uh in
spite of being a very small team
uh you know and uh i'll probably just
share you know want to do two examples i
don't know if they work
so for example this is one idea which we
did i don't know if it works here
hi can you is the voice come in your
head it's coming through
it's coming through
thank you
[Music]
so foreign tell you what's
sorry so you know what what was
happening
earlier this thing so i still remember
you know with a you know a meeting with
mondelez team and i think there was a
global campaign of generosity they
wanted people to
to donate uh you know
and that was that was the concept of
this thing and we thought of
so the thing is that the way things work
in jio and
that we don't actually go search for
case studies across the world and try to
replicate them
that's usually i've seen the concept
which
i think your voice has gone very low
can you hear me now better yeah
yeah i think it's just when you put a
video on it goes down for a
fraction so yeah what i was saying was
that uh you know
that i still remember when you were
working with mondelez this is just one
example we've got dozens of examples
and uh mondelez had a global you know uh
you know uh case study of uh you know
the idea was to get people to share
and uh and and typically the way geo geo
operates of the
is that that we don't really search for
global case studies or examples and try
to replicate them
we actually think completely afresh and
uh
because it works it's it's it's valuable
to do things
that way and a simple idea was that when
people go buy a chocolate
they should be able to you know you know
engage with the brand by and they can
click a picture of the wrapper for
example
if they're engaging with the brand then
we give them one gb of data
you know fly and and that 1gb of data
the user can then decide to keep it to
themselves
or can donate right and uh and
and this was created this was a massive
success actually okay you know
you know which we noticed with that but
head there's creativity and technology
and you know
and the and the basic you know need of
the the brief of the
of the brand all getting delivered and
you know you know so so all i'm
basically saying is
uh you know there uh there's a lot of
fun in thinking
uh his competence this is another
example this is the last one i have uh
then we'll break for uh for q a uh this
is i'll just probably talk a little
about it
this was uh done with veal
and uh you know the brand head of deal
with your off-wheel
very dear friend i think the point was
that you know what did a lot of research
and figured out that
women in the country right especially in
the rural belt or tier 2 tier 3
are not working and the main reason
they're not working is that the husbands
don't allow them to work
and that came from research and then
idea was
and today if we can make any impact to
that segment
of getting women going out and you know
joining the economy
you know the impact it has on the
overall indian economy is massive
actually
this is the biggest impact possible the
way we try to solve that idea was that
we actually carried
uh there's a program which which was
launched called garcia career
where there is a number which is added
on the wheel packet
uh missed call number you do a missed
call on it we push a url
and you click on it and you basically
did a a course for women
you know to do selected high you know
open a beauty parlor
hisab kitab and things like that again
it's it's a highly awarded campaign
but i can tell you for sure that there
is no example like that exists anywhere
and it is basically
uh you know breaking things down to the
to the to the most fundamental
and the most foundational level and then
creating uh
[Music]
[Music]
is
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
you're also giving certificates uh you
know so
yeah so you know that's that's broadly
the presentation i think the
the main message uh uncluttered is to
basically
take those people's basis so i think you
can open for q a uh
yeah okay so thank you very much uh
once again uh in terms of q a we already
have several questions on the
chat box but i'll be picking some of
them and
reading them out to you uh but before
that i'm joined
by my uh colleague on the bmw executive
committee who's also
a core faculty for the leadership
development program leader next
and uh this is mr jaguar rishi so i'm
going to request him to ask the first
question
uh he leads digital strategy and lnd at
work
juggman all yours please thank you so
much thank you so much
and also thank you very much great
learning uh
early morning on saturday so
by the way my question is uh that first
principle in action is a great concept i
mean i learned for the first time here
in fact when i was correlating it
it was used by some companies and came
out with
very innovative ideas like shampoo
pouches at the pan walas also
as a result it you know opened up
a new business for for shampoo makers
other examples can be ola uber and
airbnb my question is you know
how can startups use this concept
who have little limited resources
so no actually there's nothing wrong
with resources here it's just a way of
thinking yeah can you hear me now
is it better so actually resources
uh you know it's completely unrelated
here so there's nothing to do with
reloads it's just a way of thinking
and startups i think uh so every startup
is
unique in its own ways and the idea
really is that they need to really you
know break down their problem
in as you know at a smallest competent
level as possible
uh i mean if if the problem is uh
you know getting uh uh you know
you know getting to a certain revenue
number now that revenue number
would happen if we have a certain
customer base right with a certain asp
for example
now that customer base acquisition cost
and x amount of time
and then can there be potential
partnerships which can deliver that for
example
so it's just a it's just a physics way
of doing things right it's a
elon musk talks a lot about i think you
can you can check a bunch of these
videos but it's just a way of
and it takes a bit of practice to think
but uh but it's really
breaking down your problem into smallest
component
and uh and then playing around with
those components
uh you know in various combinations so
so idea really is that so rather than
just
copying or replicating or looking for
best case studies
uh because no startup no business
not every you know is is the same
everything it's all unique situations
so that breaking down that unique
situation and then creating uh something
so it works i can tell you for sure once
this is
uh once this is understood uh
you know the concept is very very strong
that's my biggest learning in the last x
number of years and reliance i can tell
you
so i don't know if i answered your
question yeah so yeah yeah thank you
very much
please thank you sometimes sometimes
they're scary
hold on please hold on please i have a
question to relate
um i will come to you thank you uh
and the next question i'm reading out is
is from our former president mr anand
singhanya of the
jk group and he's keeping a bit
underwhelmed so i'm reading out his
question
it's very interesting question he's
saying in the digital space
what is the balance between innovation
data mining and drivers
issues
yeah that's a that's definitely an
interesting question
actually uh i'll see if
i'll say something you know but i'm not
not with an alliance hat at all so i'll
say it on
an individual basis but uh
you know i mean
you know there are companies who have uh
taken a position like apple
on the privacy side of things for the
for the you know you know for the for
the end consumers
there are companies who have taken
positions on uh that
you know that they give things
everything you know they give everything
free so they need to
uh you know the doc and data is the only
thing they monetize uh you know
otherwise the services go
etc and there are some people who are in
between right who are
not taking a position until now i'm not
taking any names here uh because
you know most of these guys are our
partners uh
uh so so that's the that's a scenario
today you know globally speaking
right now i believe that telecom
carriers across the world you know
uh you know have a certain
responsibility towards
first party data of users right and uh
it's a responsibility
uh you know which uh because uh
you know so so i i think the only thing
i'll say that alliance will step up
uh with its with this responsibilities
today for example
we do not share ad ids across any
campaign we do on advertising site
because we you know we don't open up
that data to uh you know
to everyone because you can imagine if
everyone's data gets open to everyone
you know what what will really happen to
the consumer so so that's on the
that's on the data privacy side uh but
that's at least where you know reliance
stands uh and
some of the other people the way they
stand now the other part was
creativity and what was the other part
sorry what was the third thing
essentially privacy uh versus uh
innovation
in the digital uh area so so you said
you're doing data mining as uh
you're being innovative you're doing
data mining it leads clearly to privacy
issues what's the balance between
consumer privacy and data mining you
touched upon it in some way but if you
want to
so you know so
if there is a company abc which
you know has first party data or you
know of its users
banks have all the information around on
the commerce side
you know some other other credit would
have all the credit card
you know so whatever data that's get
that gets collected and whatever data
mining which happens
you know within that company i think
that is that's part of
you know it's basically helping the
companies you know better their services
are doing more innovations and because
uh because when they create
you know so for example a bank uh you
know it has a
understanding of who are its premium
users who are the mid users who are the
bottom users etc
now if and data mining of uh and you
know and
you know you know by them helps them
actually customize the propositions out
otherwise everything will be going out
to everyone so so in some ways
the data mining is good but as long as
it remains in that
you know within the walls of uh of that
particular company the problem it occurs
is
that when banks start putting out the
first party data
somebody some other company starts
putting all the first party data etc
that's that's a big threat to the
consumer so i think innovations
uh uh you know should continue uh
because growth is the only way and uh
but
but yeah it's a sensitive subject so you
know some things
allowed some things probably should be
checked
and talking about sensitive subjects
this is a question from me before i go
to the next question from the chat box
and this is really in the context of the
leader next leadership development
program where we are speaking about
various aspects and today we wanted to
understand innovation from you and and
so the classical question because
uh you work for jio is why do increments
fail to see
opportunities for innovation is there
something because we teach that it's not
just process it's about leadership it's
about culture
so what do you have to say about that so
i i've seen it you know i've seen it
very closely actually over the last uh
close close to six seven years i think
the incumbents uh
let us let us in so
you know and uh clearly that was the
case
and the second thing is that uh you know
the
incumbents did not realize the
opportunity on data
right and uh
the thing is that you know so i still
remember when we were doing our planning
right and all the numbers and there were
serious investments
which were done by jio but we had to
still put a number of arpu
on which the entire investments have to
you know operate
and uh so the but the fact was that
when we just to share with you and you
know what you know how jio was thinking
that one is that uh that when we looked
at the arpu
right we looked at differently we said
no there is
30 of the people who are using dual
dual sim cards so there is a capacity to
pay
more right so that's a part of the user
base
second at the bottom of the pyramid we
we notice that people are actually
you know walking down to these small
shops to get content filled in their
phone
right and they're spending 50 bucks a
month to do that so there is another set
of which is there
so we saw multiple apos uh
you know and then and looked at things
uh you know very differently
uh you know so we never looked at it as
only a two dollar industry uh you know
uh industry but we looked at that over a
period of time and you know data would
uh
you know etc so it's a it's a longer
term view so that's one thing the second
thing is
you know yes reliance did make massive
investments
but if you see the number of businesses
which get gets opened up
you know within that investment right
today uh
you know the all the offline investments
we set up close to six and a half
thousand
jio points so every seal in the country
has a geo point of hours
and which was supposedly only telecom
but today there is uh you know that's
the point
as the retail business is expanding
which is coming into play so there are
so you know
so there is it's one set of investments
but you know there are
leverage uh cross leveraged across you
know multiple businesses
so i think those are those are the few
things you know and
the last thing i would say is that uh i
still remember
that we pump jio pumped in
uh the capacities are built for data
right
and the first 170 180 days
it was five x of the total industry you
know right from day one so let's say the
total
uh data capacity was x in the country
across
all telecom operators jio had five eggs
from day one
right so uh i think these are two three
things
and uh so it's i think belief it's a
shared simple thinking and belief
of a chairman you know which
which took the industry by surprise
actually
yeah and and speaking about that uh we
have a question from sandeep kerner
which uh goes the other way
uh he's asking are big corporate houses
a threat to innovation by msmes and
startups
sorry coming in sorry are big corporate
houses a threat to innovation by
mscs msmes or startups
no i don't think there's a lot of
innovation which happens in large
enterprises and corporates actually
reliance we call ourselves
as a startup only and it operates in a
certain way that it
has all the features of a startup or a
small company the way it operates but
largely the large enterprises
they cannot move as fast as the way
msmes can move
and uh so the speed agility etcetera is
all in the favor of
msmes and uh so
yeah so i think and those things are
more important uh because today what has
happened is that you know the capital is
not a problem right
and uh so if you have the idea of the
team is right you can move fast
there is enough capital available so
msmes have great
great opportunity in the in our country
and uh versus the corporates in large
you know large corporate houses you know
even reliance right where you know it
still takes some time to move
because so msnes have great opportunity
i have two questions which i'm combining
i will read both of them together
because they are quite related
one from freezer says how do first
principles work in the case of a product
or service
which is already well established and
from sandeep we have how should we
approach innovation
when it's very challenging to grab
attention of customers with existing
brands
got it so so so the first thing is let
me just clarify a little bit
more uh uh
you know on the first principles of you
know because i this is such an important
concept i don't want people to just uh
get it wrong so uh
so for example if i if i give if i give
an example that you there is a tank
there's a bicycle
there is a uh you know the skiing
thing uh and uh you know and
you know what can you what you know what
what do you see
as a set of people now the first
principle thinkers
will see a handle they'll see
the you know the the skiing things at
the bottom they'll see a lot of metal
they'll see the stuff which can be used
in the tank and they can probably make a
snowmobile
right so in a normal scheme of things
you know who would think of snowmobile
looking at these four items for example
so so the important thing is that you
broke down those four four items which
as i said
to such a competent level that now you
now you're looking at products which are
not seen before
so that thinking is very important right
because if you don't if you're not
getting to that granular level of
thinking
you know then you could actually be
wrong so so i just wanted to clarify
that now coming down to your uh
query i think it was that what
sorry can you just repeat the question
as we answer it completely
once again so there were two questions
but essentially they were saying
uh in an existing business how do you
bring in innovation
how do you innovate when that when you
have existing brands when
uh you have existing products existing
services
those questions came in at a time when
probably you're speaking about the jio
story which had to do with entering a
new market or creating a new service
yeah so see first principles you know
applied to can the product be better
can the industry be disrupted
can uh the cost can can the cost be
brought down to a certain level
can there could be a quicker way of
entering the market etc so depending
upon the problem right so
for example you need to uh
the product is costing 100 the current
product which you are selling in the
market etc
competition is at 110 or some of them is
90 or whatever the case will be
now very fundamentally you may you're
making a detergent or you're making
a headset etc or let's say you're making
a mobile phone for example
right and uh now really when you have to
start applying first principle
what is the mobile phone it has some
metal uh a screen
you know uh uh you know a chipset you
know and uh you know basically you know
an audio portion a video portion
and all of that and there's a software
portion etc now when you open all that
out
right and i've done that exercise you
know with a material of devices it's
like you know
and all of that and really get to that
level first
and then see you know can they be just
an example of the battery pack for
example right i mean
elon musk didn't they do do do anything
different i mean he just basically
or let me take another so it's it's so
it's basically
people have to just apply first
principles like that i'll give you an
example of
what happened with the on the spacex
right and uh
so elon musk wanted to launch uh you
know you know
uh you know spacecraft and uh it checked
it i didn't
know the amounts it was costing you know
obnoxious amount of money
and then he with all the research and
work he did
you know his team realized that the
actual cost
of a satellite in terms of you put
everything on the promo product side
engineering side
r d side etc it should be costing only
two percent
off the price it is today being quoted
for you know
first year you know and
and then it basically gathered
everything which was required
today he's brought down the cost of a
spacecraft by nine times
right that's the spacex cost now that's
how
and and you will notice elon musk
talking about first principles
to exactly deliver what i'm saying so
so yes so there are there are existing
industries which can be disrupted there
are existing products which can be
better
there are faster ways of entering the
market but it's just that the problem
needs to be defined
you know you have to go a mile deep
you know in and staying with the problem
and then magic happens actually did i
did i answer that
adequately to you yeah i i hope so
yeah yes thank you thanks uh i have i
have a couple of questions which are
asking
for your views on specific sectors uh so
the first of those questions is about
uh disruption in healthcare technology
what's new what's the innovation that
india will witness in healthcare as a
sector
i'm i'm actually no expert there so i
don't you know just say anything
but uh
yeah i i think uh i think at this time
you know india is going through a lot i
think we we
you know the you know all the help which
we are getting
from across the world and uh you know
how we are grappling with with oxygen
today and everything
but uh but yeah i think
i'll only say and it's a very personal
thing that uh
the future is bright actually
uh you know people i've never
you know the level of health
consciousness which people are having
right now
right the what they're eating and what
they are you know they're thinking what
is really what they're taking in etc
i think uh we will
it'll be a lot fitter world uh
you know in here two years from now and
uh and the healthcare requirements uh
may only get uh decreased uh
you know rather than you know they
expect expectation of you know more
monies from the
from the government on the health care
but because
because end of the day you know whatever
we've done to our bodies
it's uh it's all human created problems
and uh and some of those problems are
getting addressed during the covet times
so so yeah
so yeah um we have we have an
interesting question from joy de souza
who's saying uh
so it's on the topic of fidgety so he's
saying will digital totally overcome
physical
what's the what do you think about
fidget as a as a concept
and i'm just saying his words actually
so
he believes that that
you know everything which is physical
will have a digital replica
right so there'll be a mirror of that
physical so and
uh so it is not just about uh so
so everything which we see in physical
terms today will have a
level everything that you see in the
physical uh
side will have a digital replica so and
that's the real future the fidget
is the real future and not that the
physical is going anywhere or
what digital is going to be you know i
mean today if you look at the overall
retail or commerce
etc i mean you know your your digital is
uh six seven eight percent it will go up
to uh
twelve fourteen fifteen percent the 85
percent still is the commerce is
the small mom-and-pop shops and you know
and all of that
and but there will be a there will be a
digital layer which will come on
across all the the physical locations uh
you know which is there so it's going to
be yeah so i think both are going to
coexist
and this whole replica of physical uh
is where the large opportunity of
digital actually
uh lies so yes their the future is
the future is very digital
um i i also have several other questions
which are very sector specific and i'm
not sure whether you want to get into
those i'll mention two more of them
and as you as you said for healthcare i
leave it to you whether you want to make
sector specific comments on those
uh one is with regard to education as a
sector
and uh it says can you please comment on
innovations in the education sector
after covid and the other is about the
banking and payment industry
so uh it says what's the next
description in banking and
payment after upi and licensing and so
on
so banking and education these two
sectors what do you see as upcoming
innovations
so uh yeah so i i wouldn't comment on
the banking sector
uh and i don't have the requisite
expertise that is
uh they're also valid but i know how the
industry operates from the banking and
insurance and credit cards and you know
all that space but on the
education side uh
you know i think there's there is a
there's a fundamental flaw in our in the
education system it is uh
you know the whole uh the whole exercise
of
uh of uh exams and uh
and you know and uh you know the
education system unless there's an
education system which
is making you think rather than you know
so you understand what i'm saying so you
know this is that we don't get
the kids to think a lot uh and they
they just supposed to be you know going
through the course books and you know
and giving their exams and you know and
and get and get marked etc or get in the
rut of competition
comparative exams for which they you
know they take
trainings etc so i think uh
and i haven't seen much of that
happening
uh you know there are a lot of you know
you know online uh universities and
online
uh effort you know and highly funded uh
you know stuff by juice is completely on
uh this thing but it is uh but it's all
trying to
uh you know it's uh it's only fast
forwarding the
the you know the existing flaw in the
education system
it's not doing anything revolutionary or
different right and
i believe that because
our chairman has thought through the
education system as well uh
and broken down you know to the really
competent level of the issues etc
uh and you know there is a university uh
uh
you know which is which which we are
launching as well called university etc
i think some of those things will get
addressed i think that's so
so that's that's one thing the second
thing is that you know this whole
situation of we have x number of kids
in school and after the school there's a
big drop
in terms of students getting to the
college and after the college is a big
drop of
students getting the universities and
then you know
so i think so there are plenty of things
on education and i don't think
anyone is addressing it yeah and
especially why jews were the kind of
monies
they have raised i don't think there is
anything which is
uh i'm personally saying it you know
which
which we can say that which is which is
india changing or which is
you know anything which uh to look up to
actually
so that's personal speaking
right so i'm mindful of time and and we
are going to take one last question
and after that uh we are going to uh
invite everyone to
come on video and we'll take a group
photograph uh
for for memory uh but this last question
is that
uh are there any failures in innovation
that have taught you a big lesson
no no i mean it
[Music]
and there's no way you can succeed
without failing i follow very
you know portfolio approach in my life i
get into ten things i know seven will
fail one or two will be okay one will
probably run all the all the monies and
time i've invested
so uh so failures is they're just
stepping i mean
they're just a base to find out uh you
know
how not to do a particular thing so it
is
i mean i when i hire people you know and
uh
if i can really find people who fail
once or twice
you know i know it's the greatest
decision i can make and uh
so failures at least for me and uh and i
think we value that because we're in
the corner organization as reliance uh
you know we love entrepreneurs
and i don't think there's a single
entrepreneur out there
who has reached wherever he is reached
without really
any bigger the failures bigger the
setbacks
you know bigger opportunity he has on
his hand actually
so failures and innovations you know
definitely things will fail
[Music]
okay please go ahead
you know the innocence of bill gates he
was looking
he was looking for failed managers
sometimes
the managers who failed in serious
efforts
so he thought the failing itself is not
a
disqualification but the idea behind
that
it's just a thought i thought i will add
do you have a question
i have no question but this is part of
the previous question
what what question have we learned from
the failures so okay there was a
yeah man was looking for the failed
managers okay interesting thank you
thank you uh so i i will now request
mrs our past president who's also been
the
mentor and uh the person who uh to a
large degree conceptualized the leader
next leadership development program
which has been running successfully
since 2019 as
he said said to start so uh chai ma'am
if you uh can please come in and
contextualize for us uh the last of
this year's uh leader speak uh series
and really give us your
concluding remarks which we always look
forward to and after that we will have
all of us on video for a codec moment
product is probably not here
i'm being mischievous because it's a
talk on innovation and for using the
word kodak
but uh all yours
thank you sripad thank you for that
mischievous comment uh before
i come in because it really helps
i have to begin with thanking mohit for
an insightful
session on strategy and open innovation
muhit we all have greatly benefited from
your first-hand involvement
and experience with jio which is
endorsed as one of the greatest examples
of
empowerment through digital innovation
and telecommunication
here i would like to share that india's
flight of affordable excellence to mars
which also distinguished us as the first
country to have succeeded in its maiden
attempt
and a mission to mars fits in perfectly
with the first principles of innovation
discussed by you
if you reside in any major city in india
a ride in a three-wheeler taxi to mars
would cost you
dollar 33 million more than the indian
space research organization
expanded to dispatch a spacecraft to the
same destination
the mangalyan cost only dollar 74
million about
1.25 million less than the hollywood
film gravity
making it the most economical successful
interplanetary mission in history and
israel accomplished it by working from
the grass root
reusing the same core structure and
systems as the lunar orbiter
but by prioritizing homegrown materials
and innovative technology over foreign
imports
fuel and cost efficiency using gravity
and its own preparation systems to enter
the mars's orbit and many such
initiatives this is exactly what you
tried to explain you know
that working from the grassroot and
redefining and redesigning the idea
is what becomes the basis of an open
innovation
so with your master class now we also
conclude this joint lnd initiative of
dma and jvms
based on the recommendations of world
economic forum targeted at
senior high performing corporate leaders
wherein the inaugural speech was
delivered by mr pramod bhasin
founder of gen pact and presenting
presently working as the chairman of
click's capital
and the celebrity speakers mr tv mohanda
spy
who is the current chairman of manipal
global
education dr ritu anand senior vice
president and chief diversity officer at
tata consultancy services
is deepali nyer director marketing india
and south asia cmo at ibm
and ashish basin ceo apac and chairman
india then sue aigis network
they've since then delivered the special
sessions on a variety of topics
such as congress of purpose cognitive
diversity
and digital leadership they're immensely
grateful to each one of them for sharing
their wisdom and knowledge with all of
us
and including to you i know under what
circumstances mohit you have
accommodated us
even if we postponed it but i am all
appreciation and admiration for
you for having fought at your domestic
front this pandemic and still making it
possible to
be here today and share your knowledge
and expertise
as an advisor of this nish collaborative
initiative i wish to acknowledge the
tireless efforts of dr kavita
and the core team comprising of sri
padrana jagmohan singh rishi and
vijayanthi nike
our esteemed faculties which also
includes our former president
nirmala mahindra and ec member prashanti
radhi
current president professor rs mani and
former presidents whose attendance in
these sessions encouraged us
today we had with us and suresh matre
thank you anantan suresh for joining us
and on some other occasions we had
indrapalji
dr konda sri md agarwalji
and all high profile participants bmas
ec members and jbms faculty members who
are my colleagues
bma members secretariat and students
community
we have been able to create and provide
an innovative educational offering with
your support and committed environment
committed involvement in these
in this environment where pandemic has
really
held everybody's hands backwards but
then
of course it has also opened the virtual
medium where now we are able to get
people who it was otherwise very
difficult to get
so thank you all and we look forward to
coming up next year with uh
i think another model which is going to
be relevant for what is going to be then
applicable what is going to be adding
value
then and what is going to be serving as
a great tool for the leadership
development
